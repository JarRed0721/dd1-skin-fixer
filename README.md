# DD1_Skin_Fixer

Many Darkest Dungeon skin mods are facing the issue of aliasing, which makes those incredible artworks hard to recognize. 
This project is intended to reduce all the aliasing of the skin caused by the unfitting resolution of the textures.
The tool will resize the textures into appropriate resolution, while adjusting any related file that is used in Spine for proper 
functionality of the mod.
Allowing any modders or players that want to fix this issue but don't know how or don't have time.
